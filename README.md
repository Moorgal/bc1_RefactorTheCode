Description

Using recieved website contains HTML and CSS and I refactored the code to raise the accessibility standars and to optimize it for search engines. It was done by structuring the HTML in a logical, sequential order, adding descriptive titles to the images. CSS file needed to be reorganized, cleaned out of repetition.
